# Polluted-City-Dashboard
Air Quality Report in India This Power BI dashboard analyzes air quality trends across Indian cities, focusing on key pollutants (CO, SO2, NO2, PM2.5) from 2015 to 2020. It includes comparisons of the top 5 most and least polluted cities, pollutant concentration visualizations, AQI trends, and city-wise AQI mapping for geographic insights.

**üåç Air Quality Report in India üåç**

**Overview**

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides a comprehensive analysis of air quality across various cities in India. By examining key pollutants such as Carbon Monoxide (CO), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Particulate Matter (PM2.5), and more, this dashboard offers insights into the changing levels of air pollution from 2015 to 2020. The analysis also includes a comparison of the most and least polluted cities, offering a clear understanding of air quality trends across different regions of India.

**Project Highlights**

1. In-Depth Pollutant Concentration Analysis
The dashboard visualizes the average concentrations of key air pollutants across various cities. It includes:

**CO:** Carbon Monoxide, a significant contributor to outdoor air pollution.

**SO2:** Sulfur Dioxide, harmful to human health and the environment.

**NO2:** Nitrogen Dioxide, linked to respiratory problems.

**PM2.5:** Fine particulate matter that penetrates deeply into the lungs and poses severe health risks.

**2. AQI Trends from 2015 to 2020**

The project visualizes the Air Quality Index (AQI) trends over a span of six years, showing how air quality has evolved over time. This allows users to observe whether pollution levels have increased or decreased in specific cities and across the country as a whole.

**3. Comparison of Most and Least Polluted Cities**

The report features a comparative analysis of the top 5 most polluted cities versus the top 5 least polluted cities in India:

Identifies cities with the highest and lowest AQI levels.
Analyzes trends for each city to determine if air quality is improving or deteriorating.

**4. City-wise AQI Mapping**

A geographic map is integrated into the dashboard to offer a city-wise AQI overview. Users can quickly get insights into how air quality differs across various regions, facilitating easy comparisons and spatial analysis.

**5. Historical Data and Insights**

This project utilizes historical air quality data to provide insights into long-term pollution trends and patterns. The historical view helps in understanding the impact of policy changes, industrial activities, and other environmental factors on air quality.

**6. Actionable Environmental Insights**

Through the analysis, the dashboard aims to highlight cities and regions where air pollution is at its worst, providing decision-makers with the data needed to take targeted action toward improving air quality.

**Project Goals**

The main objective of this project is to apply data analysis and visualization techniques to uncover critical insights into air pollution in India. By leveraging data, this dashboard offers solutions to one of the most pressing environmental challenges, helping to inform strategies for reducing pollution and protecting public health.

**Tools & Technologies**

**Power BI:** Used for building the interactive dashboard with advanced data visualizations.

**Data Sources:** Air quality data was sourced from publicly available datasets covering pollutant concentrations and AQI for Indian cities from 2015 to 2020.
Dataset Description
The dataset includes measurements of:

**Air Quality Index (AQI)**
Concentrations of CO, SO2, NO2, and PM2.5 pollutants
City-wise pollutant levels for major cities in India
Historical data over six years

**How to Use the Dashboard**

**Exploration:** Use the interactive visualizations to explore city-wise AQI data and compare trends.

**Analysis:** Analyze pollutant concentration levels over the years and across different regions.

**Insights:** Gain insights into the long-term impact of air pollution and understand which cities need immediate attention.

**Future Improvements**
Expanding the analysis to include more recent data beyond 2020.
Incorporating additional pollutants and health impact metrics.
Creating predictive models to forecast future AQI levels based on current trends.
